	\chapter{Introduction}
 		\paragraph{} Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play a vital role in providing aid and support to communities worldwide, especially in regions affected by natural disasters, conflicts, and socio-economic challenges.
         	\paragraph{} To effectively manage their operations, NGOs rely on various systems and technologies, including Aid Operations Management Systems.
	  	\paragraph{} These systems streamline the processes involved in planning, executing, and monitoring aid activities, ensuring efficient resource allocation and delivery of services to those in need.
   		\paragraph{} This software analysis report aims to evaluate the current landscape of AOMS solutions utilized by NGOs, assessing their features, functionalities, strengths, and limitations. 
     		\paragraph{} By examining these aspects, we seek to provide insights into the effectiveness of existing systems and identify potential areas for improvement or innovation.
    
	\chapter{Overview (Domain Analysis)}
 		\paragraph{} Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) aid operations management systems include many different components. These components include donor, volunteer, needy, geographic information system (GIS), material aid, cash aid, and work breakdown structure (WBS).
		\paragraph{} These systems include a donor management component to track and manage the resources provided by donors. Likewise, volunteer management modules enable coordinating and tracking volunteers' contributions.
		\paragraph{} NGOs use systems to manage the information of the needy people they serve. This is important to monitor and improve the impact of services.
		\paragraph{} Geographic location is critical for planning aid distribution and analyzing impact. Therefore, geographic information systems (GIS) integration plays an important role in the effective management of relief operations.
		\paragraph{} NGOs use systems to effectively manage material and cash assistance. There are special modules for recording, monitoring and using these aids.
		\paragraph{} Finally, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is important for effective planning and management of aid projects. These structures define the parts of the project and ensure that resources are used effectively.
